Acidity regulator</td><td>A food additive, which controls the acidity or alkalinity of a food.</td><td>acidity regulator, acid, acidifier, alkali, base, buffer, buffering agent, pH adjusting agent</td></tr><tr><td>2. Anticaking agent</td><td>A food additive, which reduces the tendency of components of food to adhere to one another.</td><td>anticaking agent, anti-stick agent, drying agent, dusting agent</td></tr><tr><td>3. Antifoaming agent</td><td>A food additive, which prevents or reduces foaming.</td><td>antifoaming agent, defoaming agent</td></tr><tr><td>4.

Carbonating agent</td><td>A food additive used to provide carbonation in a food.</td><td>carbonating agent</td></tr><tr><td>8. Carrier</td><td>A food additive used to dissolve, dilute, disperse or otherwise physically modify a food additive or nutrient without altering its function (and without exerting any technological effect itself) in order to facilitate its handling, application or use of the food additive or nutrient.</td><td>carrier, carrier solvent, nutrient carrier, diluent for other food additives, encapsulating agent</td></tr><tr><td>9. Colour</td><td>A food additive, which adds or restores colour in a food.</td><td>colour, decorative pigment, surface colourant</td></tr><tr><td>10.

Emulsifier</td><td>A food additive, which forms or maintains a uniform emulsion of two or more phases in a food.</td><td>emulsifier, plasticizer, dispersing agent, surface active agent, crystallization inhibitor, density adjustment agent (flavouring oils in beverages), suspension agent, clouding agent</td></tr><tr><td>12. Emulsifying salt</td><td>A food additive, which, in the manufacture of processed food, rearranges proteins in order to prevent fat separation.</td><td>emulsifying salt, emulsifying salt synergist, melding salt</td></tr><tr><td>13. Firming agent</td><td>A food additive, which makes or keeps tissues of fruit or vegetables firm and crisp, or interacts with gelling agents to produce or strengthen a gel.</td><td>firming agent</td></tr></tbody></table>
